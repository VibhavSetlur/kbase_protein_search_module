# lib/

This directory contains the module's source code and any installed clients for other SDK modules.

## Structure

- `kbase_protein_network_analysis_toolkit/` - Main source code for the toolkit, organized by functionality:
  - `assign_protein_family.py`: Assigns protein embeddings to precomputed families using centroid similarity.
  - `check_existence.py`: Checks if a protein exists in storage and retrieves its metadata.
  - `embedding_generator.py`: Generates protein embeddings using ESM-2 models.
  - `network_builder.py`: Constructs and visualizes protein networks using k-nearest neighbor methods.
  - `similarity_index.py`: Provides efficient indexing and search for large protein datasets.
  - `storage.py`: Handles hierarchical, chunked, and compressed storage for massive protein datasets.
  - `workflow_orchestrator.py`: Orchestrates the complete protein network analysis workflow.
  - `kbase_protein_network_analysis_toolkitImpl.py`: Main implementation for KBase integration.
  - `kbase_protein_network_analysis_toolkitServer.py`: Server and API interface for the module.
- `installed_clients/` - Autogenerated and utility clients for KBase services (e.g., Workspace, KBaseReport).

## Documentation

- All modules are documented with clear docstrings and modular comments.
- See each file for detailed class and function documentation.
