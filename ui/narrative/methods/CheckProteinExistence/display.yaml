parameters :
    protein_id :
        ui-name : UniProt ID (exact match)
        short-hint : Enter a UniProt ID to check for an exact match in the protein HDF5 files.
        long-hint  : Enter a valid UniProt accession (e.g., P12345). The search is an exact match in the database.

description : |
    <p>Enter a UniProt ID to check if it exists in the protein HDF5 files. The app performs an <b>exact match</b> for the UniProt ID. If found, you will see its family, metadata, and the protein embedding.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Input:</b> UniProt protein ID (e.g., P12345)</li>
    <li><b>Output:</b> Existence status, family ID, metadata, and embedding</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This app returns the protein embedding if the UniProt ID is found by exact match in the database.</p>
