- Each method has its own directory under `narrative/methods/` containing:
  - `spec.json`: Method specification for the KBase Narrative interface.
  - `display.yaml`: UI display configuration.
  - `img/`: (Optional) Images for the UI.

See [this guide](https://kbase.github.io/kb_sdk_docs/howtos/add_ui_elements.html) for details on writing method specifications.
